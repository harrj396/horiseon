# <Horiseon Challenge 1>

## Description

In this project I used pre existing HTML for a website called Horiseon.  The website was fully functioning, but the HTML wasn't up to date and could be modified to be simpler.  It also lacked comments, and one of the link on the website was broken.  For this challenge I updated all the semantic HTML, added comements, and fixed the broken link inside the website.



## Link to live version

Here is a link to the live website with my changes (https://harrj396.github.io/horiseon/#social-media-marketing)

## Usage

## Credits

Thank you to all of my classmates for their assistance in this project.  They provided powerful resources that I used to help fix the HTML.
